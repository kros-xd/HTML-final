# HTML Final Project – Restaurant Menu 🍽️

This repository contains my submission for the [Codédex](https://www.codedex.io) HTML Final Project. The goal is to build a fully functional **restaurant menu webpage** that includes a form for placing an order.

## 📄 Project Description

Create a file named `restaurant_menu.html` and build a fictional or real restaurant page. Be creative with the restaurant's name, theme, and menu items!

## ✅ Requirements

Your HTML page should include the following:

### 1. Structure
- Begin with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- Include a `<title>` inside the `<head>` with the restaurant's name.

### 2. Header Section
- An image with `id="header-img"`.
- A `<h1>` element with the restaurant's name.
- A navigation bar with anchor links to `#menu` and `#order-form`.

### 3. Main Content

#### Menu Section
- Use a `<h2>` heading titled **Menu**.
- Include at least **three `<article>` elements**, each containing:
  - An `<img>` of the menu item.
  - A `<h3>` for the item name.
  - A `<p>` description (1–2 sentences), with **price in italics**.

#### Order Form Section
- Use a `<h2>` titled **Place Your Order**.
- Include a `<form>` with:
  - Number inputs for each menu item (min: 0).
  - Radio/checkbox options for sides and add-ons.
  - A `<textarea>` for special requests.
  - A submit button labeled **Go To Checkout**.
- All inputs must have corresponding `<label>` elements.

### 4. Footer
- A `<footer>` with a `<p>` that reads:  
  `Made with love by [Your Codédex Username]`.
