# HTML Final Project ‚Äì Restaurant Menu üçΩÔ∏è

This repository contains my submission for the [Cod√©dex](https://www.codedex.io) HTML Final Project. The goal is to test one's proficiency in HTML by demonstrating what they've learned through a project.

## üìÑ Project Instructions (These are for me and not important to anyone else lol)

Create a file named `restaurant_menu.html` and build a fictional or real restaurant page. Be creative with the restaurant's name, theme, and menu items!

---

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Your HTML page should include the following:

### 1. Structure
- Begin with `<!DOCTYPE html>`.
- Include a `<title>` inside the `<head>` with the restaurant's name.

### 2. Header Section
- An image with `id="header-img"`.
- A `<h1>` element with the restaurant's name.
- A navigation bar with anchor links to `#menu` and `#order-form`.

### 3. Main Content

#### Menu Section
- Use a `<h2>` heading titled **Menu**.
- Include at least **three `<article>` elements**, each containing:
  - An `<img>` of the menu item.
  - A `<h3>` for the item name.
  - A `<p>` description (1‚Äì2 sentences), with **price in italics**.

#### Order Form Section
- Use a `<h2>` titled **Place Your Order**.
- Include a `<form>` with:
  - Number inputs for each menu item (min: 0).
  - Radio/checkbox options for sides and add-ons.
  - A `<textarea>` for special requests.
  - A submit button labeled **Go To Checkout**.
- All inputs must have corresponding `<label>` elements.

### 4. Footer
- A `<footer>` with a `<p>` that reads:  
  `Made with love by [Your Cod√©dex Username]`.

## ‚ú® Bonus
Style your page using:
- Inline `style` attributes or a `<style>` element. (I used external css)
- Revisit the ‚ÄúPower Rangers‚Äù challenge for inspiration.
